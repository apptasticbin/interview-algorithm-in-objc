/**
 You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
 Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i.
 You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. 
 That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i.
 You would not,for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
 
 EXAMPLE
 
 Input:  N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
 Output: N = 10001001100

/**
 A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte.

 Implement a function drawHorizontalline(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y) which draws ahorizontal line from (xl, y)to(x2, y).
