 Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. 
 Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold.
 Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several
 stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() 
 should behave identically to a single stack (that is,pop() should return the same values as it would 
 if there were just a single stack).
 
 FOLLOW UP
 
 Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.

 In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different
 sizes which can slid onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order
 of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the 
 following constraints:
 
 (1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next rod. (NOT MUST be the rod near by)
 (3) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
 
 Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks
