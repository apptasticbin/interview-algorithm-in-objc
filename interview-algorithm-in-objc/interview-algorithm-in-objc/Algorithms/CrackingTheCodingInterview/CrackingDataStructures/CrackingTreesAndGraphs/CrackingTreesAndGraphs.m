 - Graph: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)
 - Graph traversal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal
 - Binary tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree
 - Tree traversal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal
 - A tree is a connected graph with no cycles.
 - A forest is a graph with no cycles, i.e. the disjoint union of one or more trees.
 - tree traversal (also known as tree search) is a form of graph traversal and refers 
 to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure,
 exactly once.
 - Depth-first search (DFS): Trees can be traversed in pre-order, in-order, or post-order
 - Breadth-first search (BFS): Trees are traversed in level-order, where we visit every node 
 on a level before going to a lower level.
 - Self-balancing binary search tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree
 These structures provide efficient implementations for mutable ordered lists, and can be used 
 for other abstract data structures such as associative arrays, priority queues and sets.
 - the minimum height of a tree with n nodes is log2(n)
 - AVL tree (Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis' tree, named after the inventors) is a 
 self-balancing binary search tree. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree
 - In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; 
 if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. 
 Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, 
 where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation.
 - Red-black tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree
 - Binary search trees (BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular 
 type of containers: data structures that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory.
 They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic 
 sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e.g., finding the phone number 
 of a person by name).
 - Heap: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)
 A heap can be classified further as either a "max heap" or a "min heap". In a max heap, the keys 
 of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in 
 the root node. In a min heap, the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children
 and the lowest key is in the root node.
 In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root.
